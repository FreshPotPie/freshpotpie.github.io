<strong>Welcome to Candlelighters!</strong>
<br>
<strong>Our Mission</strong>
 <br>
<p>The<strong>&nbsp;American Childhood Cancer Organization&nbsp;</strong> (ACCO) began in 1970 by a group of parents whose children were diagnosed with cancer. 
  They came together to lobby for more research, and to support each other through 
  the diagnosis and treatment of this life threatening disease at a time when 
  very few children survived. Today, ACCO is one of the nations largest grassroots, 
  national organizations dedicated to improving the lives of children and adolescents with cancer and their families. 
  ACCO is a strong advocate for families in Washington DC, produce the highest quality materials on childhood cancer, and 
  have over 40 local affiliate organizations across the country providing direct services to the families in their communities.
</p>


<p>
 <strong>Candlelighters of Southwest Florida</strong> &nbsp;is local affiliate of ACCO founded in 1983 by Klair Snellbaker; a parent of a child diagnosed with cancer. 
  Klair continues today assisting families of children with cancer and blood disorder throughout their journey. 
  Candlelighters serves approximately 450 families in a five county area — Lee, Charlotte, Collier, Hendry, and Glades — providing support,
  education and advocacy to children as well as the professionals that care for them. The Candlelighters organization is a vital source of inspiration,
  emotional support, and assistance for newly diagnosed families, those in treatment, long term survivors, those suffering from long term effects of treatments, 
  children undergoing bone marrow treatments and to bereaved families.
